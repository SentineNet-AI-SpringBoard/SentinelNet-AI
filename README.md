#  SentinelNet-AI
## AI-Powered Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS)

---

###  **Project Statement**

The goal of this project is to develop an **AI-powered Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS)** capable of identifying malicious network traffic and cyber-attacks in real-time.  
Using **machine learning algorithms**, the system will classify network traffic as *normal* or *malicious* based on historical data.

###  **Expected Outcomes**
- Understand and analyze network traffic data and common attack types  
- Apply supervised and unsupervised ML algorithms to detect intrusions  
- Perform feature engineering and anomaly detection  
- Generate alerts/logs for suspicious traffic  
- Build a final report and presentation

##  **Problem Statement**

The goal of this project is to develop **SentinelNet**, an **AI-powered Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS)** that can automatically identify malicious network traffic and cyber-attacks in real time.  

By leveraging **machine learning algorithms**, the system will classify network traffic as **normal** or **suspicious** based on historical data.  
The model will process network traffic records, extract features, train classification models, and generate alerts when potential intrusions are detected.

##  **Dataset: CICIDS2017**

### What is CICIDS2017?

The **CICIDS2017 dataset** was created by the **Canadian Institute for Cybersecurity (CIC)**.  
It contains **real-world, labeled network traffic** captured over several days, including both **benign (normal)** activities and various **attack types**

### How to Download CICIDS2017 Dataset

1. Go to the official CIC dataset website:  
   🔗 [https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/ids-2017.html](https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/ids-2017.html)

2. Scroll down to the **“Download”** section.  

3. Choose **CSV files** (they contain preprocessed flow data generated by *CICFlowMeter*).  
   > These CSV files are ready to use for ML model training — no need to process raw PCAP files.

4. Click **Download** to get all-day flow CSVs, for example:  
   - `Monday-WorkingHours.csv`  
   - `Friday-WorkingHours.csv`
