# SentinelNet-AI-Powered Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) 

### Overview
**SentinelNet-AI** is an AI-powered Network Intrusion Detection System developed to detect malicious network traffic using machine learning techniques.  
This project uses the **CICIDS 2017 Wednesday dataset**.
## Milestone 1: Project Initialization, Dataset Acquisition, and Preprocessing

1. Project Goals and Expected Outcomes

    -Develop an AI-based NIDS to detect malicious network activity.

    -Understand network traffic data and attack types.

    -Apply machine learning models for intrusion detection.

    -Perform feature engineering and identify the most important features.

    -Generate alerts for suspicious activity and prepare analytical reports.

2. Dataset Acquisition and Exploration

    -Dataset: CICIDS2017 (Wednesday subset) from CIC Dataset.

    -Explored dataset structure, feature types, and unique attack labels.

    -Performed basic statistics and data validation to understand feature distributions.

    -Visualized data to detect anomalies and ensure data quality.

3. Data Cleaning

    -Identified missing values and visualized them using heatmaps.

    -Dropped rows with null values and removed duplicate entries.

    -Removed irrelevant features and cleaned column names for consistency.

4. Data Preprocessing

    -Encoded the categorical target column Label using LabelEncoder.

    -Standardized numerical features using StandardScaler.
   
    -Visualized feature distributions.

6. Dataset Splitting

    -Split the dataset into training (70%) and testing (30%) subsets.

    -Prepared datasets for machine learning model development and evaluation.
