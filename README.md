##  **Dataset: CICIDS2017**

### What is CICIDS2017?

The **CICIDS2017 dataset** was created by the **Canadian Institute for Cybersecurity (CIC)**.  
It contains **real-world, labeled network traffic** captured over several days, including both **benign (normal)** activities and various **attack types**

### How to Download CICIDS2017 Dataset

1. Go to the official CIC dataset website:  
   🔗 [https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/ids-2017.html](https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/ids-2017.html)

2. Scroll down to the **“Download”** section.  

3. Choose **CSV files** (they contain preprocessed flow data generated by *CICFlowMeter*).  
   > These CSV files are ready to use for ML model training — no need to process raw PCAP files.

4. Click **Download** to get all-day flow CSVs, for example:  
   - `Monday-WorkingHours.csv`  
   - `Friday-WorkingHours.csv`
